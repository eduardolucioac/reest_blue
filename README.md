# reest_blue
Restore the native KDE 5 bluetooth service connectivity with a device of your choice.

Probably due to some incompatibility with certain hardware/devices with the native KDE 5 bluetooth service is showing connection instability.

Tested on Manjaro KDE using a standard headphone.

Use: `bash reest_blue.bash`

Thanks! =D
